This isn't a real update, but rather a piece of archiving.

Way back in 2012, John Regehr from the University of Utah wrote a rather (humbling) quiz on integers in C and undefined behavior. The [quiz](http://blog.regehr.org/archives/722) has been lost to time and WordPress and I decided to spend part of the holiday restoring it.

You can check it out here
