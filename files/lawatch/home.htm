        <p align="left"><font size="2">The LaWatch Website is a
        joint project of the Faculty of Law, University of Haifa
        and the Research Center for the Study of Crime, Law and
        Society at the university. It is intended to provide a
        current statistical data of the Israeli Supreme Court
        activities based on the Court's database of judgments.
        The LaWatch objective is to spark the interest of the
        public at large in important judgments given by the Court.
        We hope that the facts found in this site will assist in
        understanding the work of the Supreme Court and its
        judges and be a suitable basis for discussions on
        possible reforms.</font></p>
