<p>Over the last few decades, the State of Israel has been going
through a process that can be called <em>legalization</em>. The
courts and the concept of the <em>law</em> are turning into
important social and political institutions in the country. Above
all, the Supreme Court stands out as being one of the dominant
authorities within the Israeli political system. It has taken
central position in public decision making procedures in society,
while displaying an extent of unprecedented involvement in other
government activities. As a result, the Supreme Court has become
a focal point of curiosity to the public at large and a favorite
of the media.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the Supreme Court is mainly based on the
important judgments given by it, but these are in a minority in
comparison to rest of the Supreme Court judgments given
throughout the year. The private and public sphere of influence
can only be learned from the daily work through the judges.
Recently, the Supreme Court itself opened an internet site where
all judgments are published online. The site contains all
judgments, not only those that appeared in the newspapers or
aroused interest in the legal community, the body responsible for
the official publication of judgments.</p>

<p>The LaWatch Website is a joint project of the University of
Haifa's Faculty of Law and the Research Center for the Study of
Crime, Law and Society at the university. It is intended to
provide a current statistical data of the Israeli Supreme Court
activities based on the Court's database of judgments. The
LaWatch objective is to spark the interest of the public at large
in important judgments given by the court. We hope that the facts
found in this site will assist in understanding the work of the
Supreme Court and its judges and be a suitable basis for
discussions on possible reforms.</p>
